# WP_labs
### Laboratory tasks [here](http://alice.pnzgu.ru/~dav/web/)

### All lab reports will be in the ["Reports"](https://github.com/SolovyovD/WP_labs/tree/master/Reports) folder.


After the first work each lab is done in the new branch. For example, the second lab is in a branch called ["Lab-2"](https://github.com/SolovyovD/WP_labs/tree/Lab-2).
